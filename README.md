# The Cancer Genome Atlas Project Database

Tools: Python (pandas, sqlite3), Sqlite3

The cancer genome atlas contains over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data [1]. 
The goal of this project was to produce a database based on a subset of datasets in the form of text files. The text files contain
information on sample information and clinical information.
